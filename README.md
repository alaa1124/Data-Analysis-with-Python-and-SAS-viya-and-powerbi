# Data-Analysis-with-Python-and-SAS-viya-and-powerbi

this project that I end to practice my analysis skills with python ,powerBI ,SAS viya 

steps that I follow serves as "the capstone of the Google Data Analytics Professional" :-

1-'Ask'
about the data and what interested to know.

2-'prepare'
first upload data into #kaggle then,with libraries in #python(panads-numby)
can find in --> https://www.kaggle.com/code/alaarabie/case-study-how-to-increase-profit-of-megacrop-com
check for types of columns

3-'clean'
Remove duplicate data(redundancy data)
check for outlier

4-'Analyse'
checks for every columns individual and ask many question to answer it with code #Python

6-'Act'
Tell the manager about your recommendations.

some tips to make effiective dashboard-:
• The directors want to have a way to choose a range of years that controls the time period that is 
displayed.
• They prefer a high-level display of profits overall and by year.
• They want to see a geographical representation of the regions, states, and cities that shows the 
profits and other details for each level.
• They want an analysis of profits by products produced, showing the analysis for Product Brand
and Product Line.
• The directors occasionally want to see details about a specific location, or a specific product, or 
both. The answers to these questions should be available at any level for locations or products. 
Typical information requested includes profits, capacity, targets, and actual quantities produced. 
They also request the percentage of actual quantities to targets and actual quantities to capacity.
